* mtheme

good looking beamer theme: https://github.com/matze/mtheme

Install via

git clone https://github.com/matze/mtheme
cd mtheme
make sty
make install
texhash

then use \usetheme{metropolis}


Install 'firasans' font for the theme to look extra slick (for now) [https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/fira-sans]


* Emacs


To make the scripts in 'slides' work, it is best (on OS X) to install
emacs via brew, either

   brew install emacs

or

   brew install emacs --with-cocoa

to get the GUI version.


Tested with Emacs 25.4, May 2016
